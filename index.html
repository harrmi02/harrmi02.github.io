                      Stage managing this show with the Luther College Visual & Performing Arts department was my first experience as a primary facilitator
                      of a complex collaborative project. The script leaves the setting and context of each scene up to the production, so the cast, production staff,
                      and technicians relied on me to ensure clear and consistent communication between everyone involved.

                      I used this Google spreadsheet to keep the costume, lighting, and sound designers informed of any decisions that were made or changed during each rehearsal.
                      I recorded each day&#8217;s changes in a new color to make them easy to find, as well as sending out reports after each rehearsal detailing what we worked
                      on and what we decided or changed. This eased the problem of the designers having to wait for the director and cast to make decisions by making it possible
                      for the designers to start work on the scenes that were set while the cast continued to experiment with other scenes instead of having to wait for everything
                      to be decided.

                      the sound board operator, and two projector operators. This is a page from my script, where I wrote out the order of the warnings and cues I needed to 
                      give the technicians in order to effectively and smoothly transition between scenes.

                      (pictured above) to put on shows and events that offer opportunities beyond those offered by the department. Although we each have a focus, we make

                      My senior project at Luther has been to work with four other students to code a web application that will help building administrators track
                      <q>lost and found</q> items. This has been my first experience with a long term collaborative coding project, particularly one where we have 
                      complete control over our design and implementation. We spent a lot of time at the beginning of the project discussing what we wanted to do 
                      and how until we were all on the same page, and we continue to check in with one another as we reach new phases of development.

                      My primary task so far has been the guest user functionality, which allows students to look up where their lost item is most likely to be. 
                      This functionality incorporates all layers of our application, as it requires the page to communicate with the server which then queries the 
                      database and returns the results to the page to be displayed, as shown above. In order to build it, I researched how to search through a 
                      database when the search terms are not pre-defined, as well as the technologies we are using for our application and how they fit together.  
                      With that knowledge, I was able to develop both the guest search and the primary search functionality for the entire application.

                      In the summer of 2015 I interned as a software developer with IBM Cloud in Rochester, MN. My primary project was to take a concept
                       and a handful of guidelines from their security team and turn it into a functioning prototype program by the end of the summer. 
                       With a little guidance from my on-site mentor, I researched the technologies my program would need to interact with and 
                       existing ways to work with them. I then successfully developed the prototype program by putting together the existing interfaces in a way
                       that, although sometimes unconventional, accomplished the goal the security team had given me.

                      While assistant stage managing this show at Luther College, I learned to better lead and mentor my peers.
                      My primary responsibility was to prepare the understudies to step in for any role should an actor fall ill or otherwise have to leave the show.
                      I worked with them to plan out when they should have the lines memorized, when they could fill in for other actors during rehearsals, and when 
                      they would start to rehearse independently from the rest of the cast. When we did separate from the cast, I led their rehearsals on the 
                      director&#8217;s behalf.

                      When I performed in this Luther College production, I pushed myself to be in tune with and responsive to my scene partner. My character and her
                      love interest, pictured above,
                      share several emotionally intimate scenes that rely heavily on subtext. This was especially significant, and in 
                      some ways especially challenging, because my character&#8217;s love interest was portrayed by two women over the course of the production.
                       Whenever I changed from one scene partner to the other, I knew I could not rely on the habits I had already formed. Instead, I challenged myself to respond
                      truthfully to my partner and the given moment.

                      Annie, a midwife who assisted a docter in treating wealthy women for hysteria, so many historical factors contributed to my performance. I and several
                      of my cast mates read <i>The Technology of Orgasm</i> by Rachel P. Maines to better understand the societal ideas surrounding 
                      hysteria and its treatment at the time. I also spent quite a bit of time considering how class differeces should inform the way I responded to the other 
                      characters. In particular, I and the actress portaying Mrs. Daldry, Annie&#8217;s love interest (who also happens to be considerably above her in 
                      station), payed close attention to how class barriers would affect our characters&#8217; developing relationship.

                      I first combined my academic interests with my love of theater when I portrayed Catherine in Luther College&#8217;s production of
                      <i>Proof</i>. Catherine is a young mathematical genius struggling with the idea that she may have inherited both her father&#8217;s talent
                      for mathematics and his mental illness. 
                      My own mathematics background (although it is nowhere near as extensive as Catherine&#8217;s),
                      enabled me to understand the context and significance of the events of the show without becoming intimidated by mathematical terms and references,
                      which in turn allowed me to spend my time exploring her intense emotional journey.

                      This was the show where I began to truly understand what it means to listen to your scene partner. <i>Proof</i> is a four person show where each scene 
                      takes place between two or three characters. With such a small cast and so much time together, we had more freedom than
                      usual to respond to each other and even to the audience. The audience reactions helped us see several of the scenes in the show in new ways,
                      and we were all attentive enough to each other to be able to explore those variations without worrying that our scene partners would not keep up.

                      Designing props for this Luther College show was my first experience having a significant role in the design of the show. <i>Arcadia</i>
                      is a show that not only uses a multitude of props but uses props from two different time periods. The creative team relied on me to keep track of
                      what props were needed, where they needed to be, and when they needed to get there. I was also in charge of finding or making the majority of the 
                      props themselves, including aging and weathering a ridiculous number of books. Although my work was largely independent, I kept in constant 
                      communication with the director and designers to make sure that my 
                      work stayed consistent with their vision.
